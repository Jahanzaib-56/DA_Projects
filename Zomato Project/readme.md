# **Zomato Data Analysis Project**

### **Project Overview**

This project involves an in-depth analysis of a dataset from Zomato to gain insights into customer preferences, restaurant ratings, ordering behavior, and spending patterns. The goal is to understand customer trends and help businesses optimize their strategies based on data-driven insights.

### **Objectives**

The analysis aims to answer the following key questions:

What type of restaurant do the majority of customers order from?

How many votes has each type of restaurant received from customers?

What are the ratings that the majority of restaurants have received?

What is the average spending on orders by couples, who are the majority of online customers?

Which ordering mode (online or offline) has received more votes?

Which type of restaurants received more offline orders?

### **Data Analysis Approach**

Data Cleaning: The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Various visualizations and statistical techniques were applied to uncover patterns in customer behavior.

Insights Extraction: Key metrics such as customer spending, votes, and ratings were analyzed to derive meaningful conclusions.

Visualization: Graphs and charts were created to present the findings effectively.

### **Technologies Used**

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization

SQL for querying structured data (if applicable)
